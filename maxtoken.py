# Here's an example of how you might handle text that exceeds the maximum token limit for a given LLM in LangChain. Mind that the following code is partly pseudocode. It's not supposed to run, but it should give you the idea of how to handle texts longer than the maximum token limit.

from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Before executing the following code, make sure to have
# your OpenAI key saved in the “OPENAI_API_KEY” environment variable.
# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the input text
input_text = "your_long_input_text"

# Determine the maximum number of tokens from documentation
max_tokens = 4097

# Split the input text into chunks based on the max tokens
text_chunks = split_text_into_chunks(input_text, max_tokens)

# Process each chunk separately
results = []
for chunk in text_chunks:
    result = llm.process(chunk)
    results.append(result)

# Combine the results as needed

final_result = combine_results(results)

# In this example, split_text_into_chunks and combine_results are custom functions that you would need to implement based on your specific requirements, and we will cover them in later lessons. The key takeaway is to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model.

# Note that splitting into multiple chunks can hurt the coherence of the text
